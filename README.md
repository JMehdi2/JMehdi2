<h1>Hi, I'm Mehdi. Welcome to my Economics Portfolio!<br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-jaddour/">Industrial Engineer | Independent Researcher in Economics</a>

<h2> About Me</h2>
<p>I graduated from the Mohammadia School of Engineers in 2019 with a degree in Industrial Engineering, specializing in Supply Chain Management. A deep interest in economics led me to pursue self-directed learning to delve into the field. In the process, I built my proficiency in English, achieved high GRE and TOEFL scores, and earned a scholarship to study Economic Analysis at Corvinus University of Budapest, where I successfully completed 30 ECTS in Fall 2022. Since then, I have channeled my focus into independent, applied research to build a broad and deep understanding of economic principles. My perspective is shaped by resilience and a commitment to understanding complex economic phenomena, particularly at the market and firm levels.<p>

<h2> Portfolio Objectives</h2>
<p>This portfolio serves as a living record of my evolving skills and work in economics. I share my work to invite discussion, welcome feedback, and connect with others in the field. Through thoroughness and clarity, I also hope to create a resource that benefits other learners navigating similar paths.<p>

<h2> Portfolio Overview</h2>
<p>This portfolio centers on a primary themeâ€”the Turkish Grocery Discount Retail Market. Within this framework, I conduct a range of analyses: macroeconomic assessments to understand market development, applications of Industrial Organization theory to examine market structure, and evaluations of specific firms to analyze their individual contexts. Additionally, the portfolio includes side projects covering other topics.</p>
